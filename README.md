## üìñ Abstract

In existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Compositional Training has become the mainstream paradigm, connecting pre-trained visual encoders and language models through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, due to its decoupled training approach, exploring the multimodal scaling properties of this paradigm is challenging.

In this paper, we focus on the Native Training of MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically investigate the model design space and scaling properties under the practical scenario of data constraints. Through an in-depth study of various design choices in MLLMs, we identify a meta-architecture that optimally balances performance and training cost. Building on this, we further explore the scaling laws of native MLLMs and reveal a positive correlation in scaling between the visual encoder and the language model.

Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM named **NaViL**, combined with a simple and cost-effective training scheme. Experimental results on 14 multimodal benchmarks confirm that NaViL's performance is comparable to state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings and contributions provide profound insights for future research on native MLLMs.

## üí° Core Insights

We conducted a systematic study on the design and scaling properties of native MLLMs, leading to five key conclusions that guided the design of NaViL:

1.  **LLM Initialization is Crucial**: Initializing the model from a pre-trained LLM significantly accelerates the convergence of multimodal training. Its performance is generally superior to training from scratch, even with a large amount of multimodal data.

    </p>

2.  **MoE Architecture is Effective**: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture can significantly enhance the model's ability to process heterogeneous data and improve overall performance without increasing inference costs (activated parameters). We found that introducing modality-specific experts for both attention and feed-forward networks (FFN) yields the best results.

    </p>

3.  **Flexibility of Visual Encoder Architecture**: For a given parameter budget, the performance of the visual encoder is nearly optimal across a wide range of depth and width configurations. Shallower encoders converge faster in the early stages of training, while deeper encoders perform slightly better with more data.

4.  **Asymmetric Scaling Effects**: Scaling up the LLM consistently improves multimodal performance, following traditional language model scaling laws. However, the benefits of scaling the visual encoder diminish, with its performance ceiling being constrained by the LLM's capacity.

5.  **Joint Scaling Law for Vision and Language**: Our research reveals for the first time that **the optimal scale of the visual encoder is directly proportional to the scale of the LLM on a logarithmic scale**. This implies that they should be scaled jointly and highlights the sub-optimality of existing compositional MLLMs that pair a fixed-size visual encoder with LLMs of different sizes.

## üèóÔ∏è NaViL Architecture

Based on the insights above, we built NaViL. It is a native, MoE-based MLLM that can be trained end-to-end and natively supports images of arbitrary resolutions.

</p>

-   **Visual Encoder**: Responsible for the initial extraction of visual information.
-   **MLP Connector**: Projects visual features into the LLM's feature space.
-   **MoE-extended LLM**: Contains modality-specific attention (MHA-MMoE) and feed-forward networks (FFN-MMoE) to fuse visual and text information more effectively.
-   **Visual Multi-scale Packing**: Further enhances model performance during inference by processing image inputs at multiple scales.

## üìä Main Results

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of NaViL on 14 mainstream multimodal benchmarks, covering general capabilities, visual question answering, OCR, chart, and document understanding.

### Comparison with SOTA Models

With comparable parameter sizes, NaViL-2B and NaViL-9B **surpass all existing native MLLMs in average performance** and achieve a level comparable to top-tier compositional MLLMs (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL). This demonstrates the superiority of our proposed native training paradigm and scaling laws.

### Qualitative Analysis

By visualizing attention maps, we found that a sufficiently large visual encoder (following our joint scaling law) helps the model focus on global information in shallower layers and promotes earlier interaction between visual and text features, which explains the performance improvement.

* Top: Using a 150M visual encoder; Bottom: Using a 1.2B visual encoder. The latter exhibits stronger global attention and cross-modal interaction even in shallow layers (Layer 1).*
